# NOTE TODO THIS IS AS VAGUE AS IT GETS. NEED TO IMPOVE THIS width height notes ASAP !

We can set a width and a height property to html elements


Block level elements like section, div, h1-6, p etc take all available width by default
Unlike Inline level elements eg. a element.

Applying 
width: 100% 
to a block level element is kind of meaningless due to its default width behavior as discussed

width/height value can either be in % or px etc.


% values refer to the width/height given/made available by the parent element

width: 50% refers to 50% of height available given by the parent element

height: 100% refers to all available height given by the parent element. The catch is the height of the content area remains only as big as its content needs it to be


explicit values in px or em or etc will set the width/height to that value irrespective of the width/height of the parent element
