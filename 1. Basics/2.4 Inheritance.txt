inheritance - means an elements also inherit some styles from the parent (direct or indirect parent) element

inheritance has very low specificity. even below the user agent style.

ex. Global styles for the whole webpage or a part of the webpage structure

ex. applying global font (same font for all)
    to apply this we can use * or body ?
    Using * selector for applying global styles is not a good idea as 1. it is inefficient in the ways CSS rules are applied 2. it has lower priority
    Using body element selector is preferred in such case.
    
We can increase the specificity of an inheritance for a property in an element by setting its value to inherit

NOTE: inheritance doesn't always work. try and master when it does by practicing
