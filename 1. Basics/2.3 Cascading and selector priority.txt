Cascading - Multiple CSS rules can apply to same element(s)
          - properties are overridden based on following criteria of specificity

Specificity - 
Resolve conflicts that arise from multiple CSS rules being applied to same element(s)

Decreasing order of Specificity - 
for styles being applied to an element, we have :-

any inline style 
> 
#id selector 
> 
.class selector :pseudo_class selector [attribute] selector 
>
element/tag selector, ::pseudo_element selector
>
universal selector (*)
>
user agent stylesheet
> 
inherit styles


NOTE: Within same selector priority, the selector which comes later cascades/override the rule applied before.

NOTE: TODO: QUESTION: * > useragent stylesheet
