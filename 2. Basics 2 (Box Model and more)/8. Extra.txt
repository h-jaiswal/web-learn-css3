Their is one more way to be more precise about targeting an element

suppose an anchor element have a class="active" 

then we can target only all anchor elements with active class by writing ->
a.active {

}




:not() pseudo clas ->

also, we can target only all anchor elements NOT having active class by writing ->

not(a.active) {

}

more on not()

all element except h1
not( h1 )  {

}

etc.


Class selector VS ID selector

Class selector are reusable in a webpage and therefore can be used to target multiple elements. These allows us to "mark" and name things for styling purposes only. (eg. main-header, section-header, main-nav__item). Most frequently used selectors

ID selector only used once per webpage and therefore can be used to target a single element only. Apart from CSS, ID can be used for on-page linking (HTML). (linking to element on same webpage, gives scroll effect to reach that element)
