All element have a default behavior - a way to caluclate its height and width - this is called content box



Content box is maintained by box-sizing property



box-sizing: content-box
box-sizing: border-box
box-sizing: unset
box-sizing: inherit
box-sizing: initial



margin is never include in the calculation


box-sizing: border-box
means
the calculation of width and height
will include
content + padding + border



box-sizing: content-box
means
the calculation of width and height
will include
content only



NOTE - box-sizing: border-box is very common and widely used

So generally, 

we set 

* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

in our CSS files



NOTE : IMP

- as margin is NOT included in the calculation
- We generally exclude the value of margins 
- for example if we want the element box to have w width and h height and box-sizing: border-box is set
- and margin is mt ml mr of top left and right
- we can set
- height: (h-mt)
- width: (w-ml-mr)
- A NOTE: Please keep a note of margin-collapse scenario in this calculation
