Every element in HTML is interpreted as a box (with four layers) in CSS

This concept is called Box Model

Box Model -

innermost we have CONENT surrounded by PADDING which is surrounded by BORDER and outermost we have the MARGIN layer

CONENT < PADDING < BORDER < MARGIN

CONENT can be text/image/video/audio etc


PADDING is the space between border and CONENT

MARGIN is the space outside BORDER

Increasing the PADDING, BORDER, MARGIN will decrease the amount for CONENT

i.e if you Increase the PADDING or BORDER or MARGIN then it is increased in the inwards
