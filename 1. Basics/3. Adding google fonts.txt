In every browser, we can go to browser preferences and change the default preferences for fonts, etc.

Some basics font families are sans-serif, serif and monospace.


Change font family in CSS

In CSS- 

Google fonts is a third party font provider ( and other things as well aka icons )

1. Go to Google Fonts
2. Select a font
3. Copy its link and add it inside of the head element
example 
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Oswald:wght@200&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

NOTE - In step 3, these link element should be present before the link element for external CSS, so it will be loaded before CSS and be available for use. 

NOTE - what is rel = "preconnect" ?
The preconnect keyword for the rel attribute of the <link> element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that origin.

NOTE: TODO : earlier there was only one link element required, what changed? GOOGLE

4. add its font family in CSS in the desired selector
example   h1 {
    font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;
}
