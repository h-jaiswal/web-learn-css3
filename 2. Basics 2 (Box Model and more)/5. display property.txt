In HTML we got inline and block level elements


In layman terms, we can say the difference is that a block level element take full available width eg. p, h1-6, div, section, main, li, etc
while inline element eg. <a></a> takes only that much width as required by its content (block level element take a new line vs inline element do not necessarily take a new line)


We can set border for both inline/block level elements
We can set padding, margin for block level elements only
Apart from this we cannot set padding, margin for inline only elements 



The
display
property allows us to change the behavior of an element to block or inline or inline-block or none



display: none   takes the element out of the visible document flow but it is still present in the document DOM (Useful in JS things etc.)



If we set
display: inline-block
then the element as much width as required for its content like inline element but at the same time we can set padding, margin like block level element
