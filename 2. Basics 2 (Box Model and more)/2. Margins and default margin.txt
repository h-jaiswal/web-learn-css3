Setting margin of body element to 0

body {
    margin: 0;
}

# NOTE : Margins of other element inside of body element do not get set to 0 due to inheritance because user-agent stylesheet sets default values for these properties and it has higher specificity than inheritance



Now,
All element have default margins from user agent stylesheet

We can reset margin/padding/border of all elements using * selector as below
* {
    margin: 0;
}



Margin collapse
If you got two block elements next to each other, then margins of both elements on sides facing each other. Bigger margin wins Margin Collapse.

Try setting only either margin-top or margin-bottom all over the elements in a webpage if you worry too much about margin collapse.
