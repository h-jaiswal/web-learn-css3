There are many pseudo classes we can apply to style different dynamic states of an element

eg

An index of standard pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements on the MDN website

:pseudo class allows to define the style of a special state of an element (eg. :focus, :hover, :active) or allows to be more precise on what to select (eg. :first-child, :first-of-type)

::pseudo-element allows to define the style a specific part of an element (eg. ::first-letter, ::after, ::before)
